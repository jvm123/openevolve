Evaluate the following poem:
1. Beauty: Is it beautiful?
2. Inspiring: Is its message inspired and meaningful?
3. Emotion: Does the poem trigger an emotional response?
4. Creativity: Is it creative?
5. Syntax: Is its syntax good? Is it only a poem or does it also contain non-poem content (if yes, rate as 0)? Are its lines overly long (if yes, rate low)?
6. Length: Is it in a good length? If should be a short poem, but if it is too short or too long, give a low rating. The poem should be just a few lines long, because that is a beauty aspect.
7. Overall score: Give an overall rating. If Poem, Syntax or Length evaluation was not okay, give a bad overall feedback.

For each metric, provide a score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 is best.
