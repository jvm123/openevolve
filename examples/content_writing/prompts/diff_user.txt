You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original text to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement text
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
poem stub
=======
Tyger Tyger, burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immortal hand or eye
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match text in the current solution. If the solution is a blank placeholder, make sure to respond with exactly one diff replacement -- searching for the existing placeholder string, replacing it with your initial solution.
