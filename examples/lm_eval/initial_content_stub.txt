Question: There are 3 workers producing chairs in a furniture factory. Each of them produces 4 chairs an hour. As a group, they produce an additional chair every 6 hours. In total, how many chairs have been produced after 6 hours?
Answer: The workers produce a combined total of 3 workers * 4 hours = <<3*4=12>>12 chairs every hour.
After 6 hours, they have therefore produced 12 * 6 = <<12*6=72>>72 chairs.
Adding the additional chair means the total amount of chairs produced is 72 + 1 = <<72+1=73>>73 chairs.

Question: Isabella has $45 more than Sam but only $15 more than Giselle. If Giselle has $120, calculate the total amount of money each shopper will receive if Isabella, Sam, and Giselle donate the money to three shoppers at their local town's supermarket who then decides to share it equally.
Answer: If Isabella has $15 more than Giselle, she has $120+$15 = $135
Combined, Isabella and Giselle has $135+$120=$<<135+120=255>>255
Isabella has $45 more than Sam, meaning Sam has $135-$45=$90
Together, Sam, Isabella, and Giselle has $255+$90=$<<255+90=345>>345
if they donate the money to three shoppers at their local town's supermarket who share it equally, each shopper will receive $345/3=$<<345/3=115>>115

Question: In Fred the Farmer's barn, there were 100 horses, 29 sheep, and 9 chickens. Brian bought half of the animals and sold them at the market. Jeremy then gifted Fred an additional 37 goats. If exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, how many male animals are there in the barn?
Answer: Fred's barn started with 100 + 29 + 9 = <<100+29+9=138>>138 animals.
Brian bought half of these, so there were 138 / 2 = <<138/2=69>>69 remaining.
After Jeremy gifted Fred 37 goats, there were 69 + 37 = <<69+37=106>>106 animals in the barn.
So, 106 / 2 = <<106/2=53>>53 of these animals are male.
