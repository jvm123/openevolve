Question: A charity is delivering chicken and rice dinners to a shelter for the hungry. They have a hundred plates to deliver. The rice cost ten cents a plate and the chicken cost forty cents a plate. How many dollars did the charity spend on the food for the dinners?
Answer: Each chicken and rice plate cost 10 + 40 = <<10+40=50>>50 cents.
The charity spent 50 * 100 = <<50*100=5000>>5000 cents for the dinners.
There are 100 cents in a dollar, so the charity spent 5000 / 100 = $<<5000/100=50>>50 for the dinners.

Question: Mary, Edna, and Lucy are athletes who train every Saturday. Mary ran 3/8 of a 24-kilometer field on one Saturday. Edna ran 2/3 of the distance of Edna, and Lucy ran 5/6 of the distance of Edna. How many more kilometers should Lucy run to cover the same distance as Mary?
Answer: Mary ran 3/8 x 24 = <<3/8*24=9>>9 kilometers.
Edna ran 2/3 x 9 = <<2/3*9=6>>6 kilometers.
Lucy ran 5/6 x 6 = <<5/6*6=5>>5 kilometers.
Lucy should run 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 kilometers more.
