Question: Ruth goes to school 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. She is in math class 25% of this time. How many hours per week does she spend in math class?

Question: Allyn is a golfer. At the starting tee, he hit the golf ball and it traveled 180 yards straight toward the hole.  On his second turn, he hit the ball again straight toward the hole and it traveled half as far as it did on his first turn, but the ball landed 20 yards beyond the hole.  On his third swing, he hit the ball onto the green and it rolled into the hole.  What is the distance, in yards, from the starting tee to the hole?
Answer: On his second turn, the ball traveled 180/2=<<180/2=90>>90 yards.
After two turns, the ball had traveled 180+90=<<180+90=270>>270 yards.
Since, after the second turn, the ball was 20 yards past the hole, this means the distance from the starting tee to the hole was 270-20=<<270-20=250>>250 yards.
#### 250

Question: A family of 12 monkeys collected 10 piles of bananas. 6 piles had 9 hands, with each hand having 14 bananas, while the remaining piles had 12 hands, with each hand having 9 bananas. How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves?
Answer: The first 6 bunches had 6 x 9 x 14 = <<6*9*14=756>>756 bananas.
There were 10 - 6 = <<10-6=4>>4 remaining bunches.
The 4 remaining bunches had 4 x 12 x 9 = <<4*12*9=432>>432 bananas.
All together, there were 756 + 432 = <<756+432=1188>>1188 bananas
Each monkey would get 1188/12 = <<1188/12=99>>99 bananas.

Question: Shane wants to take as many photos as possible this year. He takes 146 photos in the first 2 months of the year. In January, he takes 2 photos every day. The rest of the photos were taken in February. If in February he took an equal number of photos each week, how many photos did Shane take each week in February?
Answer: Shane takes a total of 2 photos/day * 31 days = <<2*31=62>>62 photos in January.
This means he must have taken 146 total photos – 62 January photos = 84 photos in February.
As he took an equal number each week, he must have taken 84 photos / 4 weeks = <<84/4=21>>21 photos each week.
